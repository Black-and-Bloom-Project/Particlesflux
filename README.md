# Script to calculate the dry deposition flux of particles

This Python script was created to allow the calculation of the dry deposition fluxes of particles by two different input datasets (monitored at a specific location):
1) meteorological data (temperature and wind velocity)
2) particle number concentrations (obtained from OPC monitoring)
