# Script to calculate the dry deposition flux of particles

Developed by Nuno Canha
Version 1 - September 2022

This Python script was created to allow the calculation of the dry deposition fluxes of particles by two different input datasets (monitored at a specific location):
1) meteorological data (temperature and wind velocity)
2) particle number concentrations (obtained from OPC monitoring)

As an example, two datasets are available:
1) WD_Minute_data.csv
2) OPC raw data.csv
